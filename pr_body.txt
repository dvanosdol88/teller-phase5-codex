This PR adds manual liabilities/assets support with calculated totals.

What
- SQL migration: manual_liability + manual_asset (with seeds)
- Store: slug-based manual store (no account linkage)
- Server: new endpoints and summary totals
  - GET /api/manual/summary
  - PUT /api/manual/liabilities/:slug
  - PUT /api/manual/assets/property_672_elm_value
- Tests: manual-liabilities-assets-test.sh (read summary + write gating)

Design
- Liabilities slugs: heloc_loan, original_mortgage_loan_672, roof_loan
- Asset slug: property_672_elm_value
- TotalLiabilities = sum(outstanding_balance_usd) (null->0)
- TotalAssets = sum(Teller balances) + manual asset (null->0)
- TotalEquity = assets - liabilities

Flags
- Reads always enabled.
- Writes require: FEATURE_MANUAL_DATA=true and FEATURE_MANUAL_LIABILITIES/FEATURE_MANUAL_ASSETS=true.

How to test locally
- Start server with DATABASE_URL and FEATURE_MANUAL_DATA=true
- Read-only: BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000 bash test/manual-liabilities-assets-test.sh
- Writes: also set FEATURE_MANUAL_LIABILITIES=true FEATURE_MANUAL_ASSETS=true and curl PUT endpoints.

Next
- UI PR to expose fields under Liabilities and Assets with static "Due Date | 25th of month" labels and totals.
