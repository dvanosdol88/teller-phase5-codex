# Passcode Feature Integration

## Overview

The passcode startup screen feature has been successfully integrated into the teller-phase5-codex application. This feature adds a lightweight 4-digit passcode gate to prevent casual visitors from accessing cached financial data.

## What's Included

The passcode feature consists of three main files in the `visual-only/` directory:

1. **passcode-overlay.html** - HTML markup (integrated into index.html)
2. **passcode-logic.js** - JavaScript functionality
3. **passcode-styles.css** - CSS styling

## Integration Details

### HTML Changes (visual-only/index.html)

1. Added `passcode-locked` class to the `<body>` tag
2. Added passcode overlay HTML right after the opening `<body>` tag
3. Wrapped all main content in a `<div class="page">` container
4. Added CSS and JS file references before closing `</body>` tag

### JavaScript Changes (visual-only/index.js)

Modified the `boot()` function to call `await waitForPasscodeUnlock()` before any app initialization. This ensures the passcode screen blocks all access until the correct code is entered.

### CSS Changes (visual-only/passcode-styles.css)

Added button styles for the `.btn--primary` class to ensure the unlock button displays correctly.

## Configuration

### Changing the Passcode

Edit the constant in `visual-only/passcode-logic.js`:

```javascript
const PASSCODE = '2123';  // Change to your desired code
```

### Changing Number of Digits

1. Update the `PASSCODE` constant in `passcode-logic.js`
2. Add/remove `<input>` elements in `index.html` (search for "passcode-input")
3. Update the hint text to match the new digit count

## Features

### User Experience
- **Auto-focus**: Automatically focuses the first input on page load
- **Auto-advance**: Moves to next input when a digit is entered
- **Auto-submit**: Submits form when all 4 digits are filled
- **Paste support**: Can paste full 4-digit code at once
- **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys and backspace work intuitively
- **Error handling**: Clear error message on incorrect passcode
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and roles for screen readers

### Security Features
- **Password inputs**: Digits are masked as entered
- **Dashboard lock**: Main content is inert and unclickable until unlocked
- **Visual barrier**: Blurred overlay prevents reading dashboard content
- **No localStorage**: Passcode is hardcoded, not stored client-side

## Testing

The passcode feature has been tested and verified:

✅ Correct passcode (2123) unlocks the app
✅ Incorrect passcode shows error message
✅ Error message clears when typing again
✅ Inputs are cleared after incorrect attempt
✅ Auto-advance works when typing
✅ Auto-submit works when all 4 digits entered
✅ Background content is not clickable while locked
✅ All existing tests pass without regressions

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support ✅
- **Firefox**: Full support ✅
- **Safari**: Full support ✅
- **Mobile browsers**: Full support ✅

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- ⚠️ Passcode is **hardcoded in JavaScript** (visible in source)
- ⚠️ No backend validation
- ⚠️ No rate limiting on attempts
- ⚠️ Suitable for **household/personal use only**

### For Production Use

If you need stronger security, consider:

1. **Backend Validation**: Send passcode to server for validation
2. **Rate Limiting**: Lock out after multiple failed attempts
3. **Hash the Passcode**: Store hash instead of plaintext
4. **Session Management**: Use httpOnly session cookies

See the `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` attachment for detailed examples of these security enhancements.

## Files Modified

- `visual-only/index.html` - Added passcode overlay markup and wrapper div
- `visual-only/index.js` - Added passcode unlock call in boot function
- `visual-only/passcode-logic.js` - New file (passcode functionality)
- `visual-only/passcode-styles.css` - New file (passcode styling)

## Deployment

The passcode feature is ready for deployment. No additional configuration is required. The feature will work immediately upon deployment to any environment.
