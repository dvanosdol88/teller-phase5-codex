# GitHubber Agent Memory & Workflow Standards

## CRITICAL: Post-Commit/Merge Tag Creation Protocol

### MANDATORY WORKFLOW - AFTER EVERY COMMIT/MERGE:

**Step 1: Ask User Status (REQUIRED - NEVER SKIP)**
```
## Status Check for Commit [hash] ([description])

1. From your perspective, is the app 'working' or doing what it's supposed to be doing?
   - YES - Everything working as expected
   - NO - Something's not working
   - PARTIAL - Some features work, some don't

2. If NO/PARTIAL, what's not working?

3. Any OTHER NOTES you want to add about this state?
```

**Step 2: Run Automated Tests (if available)**
- Run test scripts
- Document results

**Step 3: Create Tag with Complete Status**
Tag format: `snapshot-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` (NOT "working-baseline" unless user confirms YES)
Tag message must include:
```
Commit: [hash] - [description]

USER STATUS: [YES/NO/PARTIAL]
What's Not Working: [user's answer or N/A]
Test Results: [automated test output]
User Notes: [any additional notes]

Date: [timestamp]
```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- NEVER assume code is "working" just because tests pass
- NEVER create "working-baseline" tags without user confirmation
- User perspective is REQUIRED - automated tests are supplementary
- Tags should be neutral ("snapshot") until verified by user as "working"

---

## CRITICAL: Commit Status Tracking Pattern

### Front and Center of EVERY Commit Documentation

**ALWAYS include this section in commit messages and PR documentation:**

```markdown
## Commit Status Tracking
- Working before commit: YES/NO/UNKNOWN
- Working after commit: TBD/YES/NO
```

---

## CRITICAL: MANDATORY NEXT STEPS Section for All PRs with Code Changes

### Required for ANY PR that includes code changes

**EVERY PR with code changes MUST include:**

```markdown
## NEXT STEPS

### IMMEDIATE:
[What needs to happen right away after this PR merges]

### SHORT RUN:
[What should be done soon - next few PRs/sessions]

### LONG RUN:
[Future considerations, tech debt, scaling needs]
```

### Workflow Integration

1. **Before Creating PR:**
   - Think through immediate implications of merged code
   - Consider short-term follow-ups needed
   - Identify long-term tech debt or scaling considerations
   - If truly no next steps exist, can mark sections as "N/A" (rare)

2. **In PR Description:**
   - Include NEXT STEPS section after Test Evidence
   - Be specific and actionable
   - Link to issues where appropriate
   - Ask user for input if unclear

3. **Importance Level:**
   - Same priority as Commit Status Tracking
   - Cannot be skipped for code changes
   - Helps maintain project momentum and visibility

### Example PR with NEXT STEPS

```markdown
## Test Evidence
- Smoke test: âœ…
- Postman collection: âœ…

## NEXT STEPS

### IMMEDIATE:
- Verify feature flags work in production environment
- Monitor error logs for 24 hours post-deploy

### SHORT RUN:
- Add input validation for negative loan amounts (#124)
- Create integration tests for totals calculation (#125)
- Update user documentation with manual entry workflow

### LONG RUN:
- Consider adding audit log for manual data changes
- Evaluate moving to TypeScript for better type safety
- Plan for bulk import feature (CSV upload)
```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- NEVER create a PR with code changes without NEXT STEPS section
- ALWAYS think about implications beyond the immediate change
- Ask user if unsure what next steps should be
- This section is as mandatory as Commit Status Tracking

### Workflow Integration

1. **Before Making Any Commit:**
   - Run tests if available
   - Verify functionality manually if tests don't exist
   - Document status as YES/NO/UNKNOWN
   - If UNKNOWN, note why (e.g., "Unable to test locally, requires production DB")

2. **In Commit Message Body:**
   - Always include the tracking section
   - Be honest about pre-commit state
   - Mark post-commit as TBD initially

3. **After Commit Completes:**
   - ASK USER for status verification (see Post-Commit Tag Protocol above)
   - Run automated tests
   - Create snapshot tag with complete information
   - If status changed from YES to NO, investigate immediately

4. **In PR Documentation:**
   - Include aggregate status for all commits
   - List any commits where status degraded
   - Provide test evidence when claiming YES

### Example Commit Message

```
feat(manual-assets): add UI wiring for manual liabilities/assets

- Add input fields for 672 Elm Value, HELOC, Mortgage, Roof loans
- Wire Save buttons to PUT endpoints
- Fetch and display calculated totals
- Add smoke test script for UI workflow
- Include Postman collection for manual testing

Commit Status Tracking:
- Working before commit: YES (smoke test passes, totals calculate)
- Working after commit: TBD

Closes #123
```

### Example PR Summary with Tracking

```markdown
## Summary
UI layer for manual liabilities/assets with totals calculation and test automation.

## Commit Status Tracking (Aggregate)
- All commits working before: YES
- All commits working after: YES (verified via smoke tests)
- Any degradation: NO

## Test Evidence
- Smoke test: `BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000 bash test/ui-smoke-manual-summary.sh` âœ…
- Postman collection: All endpoints tested âœ…
- Manual verification: UI inputs save and totals update âœ…
```

## Standard Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body with detailed explanation>

Commit Status Tracking:
- Working before commit: YES/NO/UNKNOWN
- Working after commit: TBD/YES/NO

[Optional: Co-Authored-By, Closes, etc.]

### Types
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only
- **style**: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding missing tests
- **chore**: Maintain, dependencies, etc.

## PR Creation Workflow

### Before Creating PR

1. **Run all tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   # Or project-specific test command
   bash test/ui-smoke-manual-summary.sh
   ```

2. **Document test results:**
   - Screenshot if UI changes
   - Test output logs
   - Manual verification checklist

3. **Verify commit history:**
   ```bash
   git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline
   ```

4. **Check all commits have status tracking:**
   ```bash
   git log origin/main..HEAD --format="%B" | grep -A 2 "Commit Status Tracking"
   ```

### PR Template

```markdown

## Agent Memory: Key Learnings

### Project: teller-phase5-codex

**Current Understanding:**
- Manual liabilities/assets feature with slug-based storage
- Feature flags control write access (FEATURE_MANUAL_DATA, FEATURE_MANUAL_LIABILITIES, FEATURE_MANUAL_ASSETS)
- Reads are always safe, writes are gated
- Totals calculated from both Teller accounts and manual entries
- UI wiring complete with save buttons and totals display

**Testing Strategy:**
- Smoke tests for read-only operations
- Postman collections for full API testing
- Feature flag gating verified via 405 responses
- Manual verification of UI interactions

**Patterns Observed:**
1. Progressive enhancement: backend first (PR #10), then UI (PR #11)
2. Safety-first: reads always work, writes require explicit flags
3. Comprehensive testing: bash scripts + Postman + manual verification
4. Clear documentation: TESTING.md files explain full workflow
